Attack on Titan

I've always been fat. Strong, but also fat. I have practiced a lot of martial arts in my life, most of them were very hard for me, but they taught me a lot of things.
I've always been violent as well, ironically. I lost count of the times I had entered a fight without valid reasons. Growing up I realized it was futile to fight, specially because there's always someone stronger. That means I would end up in a grave if I didn't stop.
Many years later I decided to change, a friend of mine invited me to a jiu-jitsu fight. They fight in the ground, using their body weight, strength, technique and literally every other thing in their reach to make the other one give up fighting.
The martial arts I had practiced until now had a very different goal.
Judo: to disarm
Kick box: to knock out and defend
Muay thai: to keep distance
Capoeira: to threat
But jiu-jitsu was different, its goal is to absolutely destroy the opponent, break them, if needed. The way I found of not being violent was to never think of violent solutions and to never really use my strength, so I thought It would be hard for me to experience what my friend wanted me to.
Still, he insisted. "Don't worry, they train to stop people like you and me". He said, to calm me down. He's 6ft and jacked, so I didn't quite believe in him.

Entering the tatami, one of my fights was against a woman shorter than me, I'm 5,2 so that worried me. Little did I know I was being a fool.
She was fast and had technique, all I had was a low gravity center and good reflexes.
She tried to knock me down in traditional ways, but I was too heavy for her. I tried to knock her down, but she was too fast.
She tried to break me, but I was too strong for her. I tried to break her, but she was too skilled.
Still, she had the upper hand. So she did something I saw in an anime and never thought I'd see in real life: she fucking disappeared.
She stand up, looked straight at me with a firm face, took position of fighting and just poof. Last thing I knew she was behing me. Before I could turn over she had her arms around my neck.
The moment she did that, we heard the buzzer. That means the fight was over and we should stop, but neither of us wanted to stop.
She performed a headlock on me, but before she could get the right grip I grabbed both of her arms and began pulling. Knowing she'd lose a strength fight, she performed a leglock around my waist to knock me down. That way she evened out the strength. If I failed in pulling her arms, I'd choke. If I failed in keeping balance, I'd fall. Either way, I was in her hands.
I started walking in order to keep balance. In that moment, in what seemed hours to me. I remembered of every time I fought. Every time I used my strength to hurt someone and every time I used all of my strenght to break something. In that moment, I had a conversation with my past self.
"Can I do it?" - I asked myself and took a step. In each step, another question popped into my head: "Can I use all of my strength?". "Won't she get hurt?". "What if I break her?".
After a couple of seconds of struggling, I remembered what my frend told me: "Don't worry, they train to stop people like you and me". So I finally made terms with me and decided: I'm going all out.
With all of my strength, I started squeezing her wrists while pulling her arms foward, pushing the ground with my right foot and keeping my left foot steady for balance.
I was sure I'd lose a resistance fight and she found the perfect position to breath while trying to knock and break me down. So I tried to explode.
Inch after inch, second after second, her arms started to give up and, while breathing like a bull, I could hear her falling to the ground. That's when I let go of her arms and turned over to her smile.
"Almost got you" - she said, firmly.
"Almost didn't make it" - I laughed.
jiu-jitsu is just amazing.
